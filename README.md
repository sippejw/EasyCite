# EasyCite
Hackathon project for CUHackit at Clemson University. Goal was to create a mobile app for easily citing sources in academic essays.

# Results
Allows you to take a picture of the ISBN of a textbook, and loads metadata into your account's library related to that project.
Once you have the textbook in your library, you select the textbook and take a picture of text you want to copy into your paper.
Once the text in the image is processed it is available to you in a google docs addon.
